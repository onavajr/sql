    <h1>SQL Command Lists</h1>
    <pre>
        SELECT - is used to select data from a database.
        Syntax:
            SELECT column1, column2, ..
            FROM table_name;
        ------to select all data-------
            SELECT * FROM table_name;

            Ex:
                SELECT CustomerName, City FROM Customer;
                SELECT * FROM Customer;

        SELECT DISTINCT - used to select the different values(does not return a duplicate value);
        Syntax:
            SELECT DISTINCT Country FROM Customers;
            SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Country) FROM Customers;

            Note: This does not support Firefox, the code below Will work...
            SELECT Count(*) AS DistinctCountries
            FROM (SELECT DISTINCT Country FROM Customers);
        WHERE - clause is used to filter records.Extract data depending on the condition.
                - can you different operators:
                    = > < >= <= <> BETWEEN LIKE IN
        Syntax:
            SELECT column1, comlumn2, ...
            FROM table_name
            WHERE condition;

            TextFields vs. Numeric
            WHERE CustomerID = 1; this is Numeric
            WHERE Country = 'Mexico'; this is textfield
            EX:
                SELECT * FROM Customers
                WHERE Country = 'Mexico';

                This only display Mexico countries.

        WHERE Claus can be combined with AND OR NOT
