        SELECT TOP is used to specify the number of records to return.
        --Note: Not all database systems support the SELECT TOP clause. MySQL supports the LIMIT clause to select a limited number of records, while Oracle uses FETCH FIRST n ROWS ONLY and ROWNUM.
        Syntax: SQL Server/MS Access Syntax:
            SELECT TOP number | percent column_name(s)
            FROM table_name
            WHERE condition;
        Syntax: MySQL Syntax:
            SELECT column_name(s)
            FROM table_name
